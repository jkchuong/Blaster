# Blaster
A third person multiplayer shooter created in Unreal Engine 5 using the [multiplayer plugin](https://github.com/jkchuong/UE5-Multiplayer-Plugin) for allowing multiplayer session functionality. 

Repository is missing an "Assets" folder containing various assets such as animations and meshes as the repository would be too large. Instead, linked below are the assets I used:
- [Animation Starter Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/animation-starter-pack)
- [Military Weapons Silver](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/military-weapons-silver)
- [Unreal Learning Kit](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/unreal-learning-kit)
- [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)
